    <h2>Clayton Shupe</h2>
    <p> Hey guys! I'm 33 years old have been happily married for 9+ years now. 
        I figured it was high time I got back to school so I'm majoring in 
        applied technology and still have quite a bit to go. Some of 
        my hobbies are gaming, movies/shows and anything outdoors. 
    </p>
    <p> So far I've loved everything about BYUI and can't wait to see what else is in store. 
        The people are so nice and helpful which is perfect for an online student. 
        I thought programming and web design would be a good place for me to start 
        when pursuing a career. I love everything about computers and can't wait to 
        see what type of programs/websites I can whip up! 
    </p>  
    <p> I've been a member of the church my entire life and it's helped me accomplish so many things in life. 
        I couldn't imaging going to school without the aid of the holy ghost and hope 
        you all feel the same way. This opportunity is such a blessing and I pray that we 
        all succeed as disciples of Christ. 
    </p>
